Quality softwares are a good thing.
Everybody wants a well-made, bug-free, efficient, responsive, stable software. As a software manufacturer, selling high-quality is definitely the biggest arguent you can find against your competitors. Customers will probably choose stable software with fewer features that work well, rather than an unstable homologue, even though it's packed with features, especially if it comes with the promise of bringing the missing bits eventually. People love to buy quality products; People love to sell quality products. Everything seems so simple, we might wonder why there are so many applications in the industry which suffer from poor quality, high maintenance costs, countless man-hours spent in bug-fixing and dedicated 24/7 customer-services.

Well, in order to have them, people have to write them. It certainly does seem obvious when put that way, but many, many players in the industry, including big names, believe they can skim on the time they spend on the quality of their software. Well, of course it is a non-neglectable price to pay, but - hey - you get what you pay for.
